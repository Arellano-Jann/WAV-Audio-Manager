{\bfseries{Issues}}

\DoxyHorRuler{0}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Low Pass Filter doesn’t work with the method described in the hints. It only creates a delay. Fourier Transform would work but I am too “not good at math” to know how to code that.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Challenges}}

\DoxyHorRuler{0}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Many segmentation faults that were caused by Print\+Meta\+Data() taking in a copy of the \mbox{\hyperlink{classWav}{Wav}} object instead of a reference causing two deletions of the sample array.
\item Creating a really advanced makefile made me read half of the G\+NU Make documentation to have a really cool makefile. Implicit rules don’t work with my makefile but I’m satisfied that it looks cool.
\item Putting .cpp and .h files in a directory made for a challenge when creating the makefile.

{\bfseries{Application Building}}

\DoxyHorRuler{0}


{\ttfamily make} builds the program and the necessary directories

{\ttfamily make clean} cleans the root folder of the .exe and .wav files. It also cleans the objs directory of all .o files.

{\bfseries{How To Use This Application}}

\DoxyHorRuler{0}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Build Application
\item Enter “./wavman” in Your Terminal to Run the Application
\item Enter the Name of the .wav File You Wish to Edit
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item OR Type “q” to Exit the Program
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The Application will Display the File’s Metadata, and Ask You to Choose a Processing Method to Apply to Your .wav File
\item Enter a Number Based on Which \mbox{\hyperlink{classProcessor}{Processor}} You Would Like to Use
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item (1) \mbox{\hyperlink{classNormalization}{Normalization}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This Processing Method Will Maximize the Amplitude of Your File
\item This Processing Method Will Automatically Apply to Your File and Return You to the “\+Choose a Processing Method” Page
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item (2) \mbox{\hyperlink{classEcho}{Echo}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This Processing Method Will Create an \mbox{\hyperlink{classEcho}{Echo}} Effect from Your File
\item This Processing Method Will Ask You to Enter a Percentage to Scale the Echo’s Volume, then it Will Ask You to Enter a Delay Value by Number of Samples, and Return You to the “\+Choose a Processing Method” Page
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item (3) \mbox{\hyperlink{classGain}{Gain}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This Processing Method Will Raise or Lower the Overall Amplitude of Your File
\item This Processing Method Will Ask You to Enter a Percentage to Scale the Overall Amplitude, and Return You to the “\+Choose a Processing Method” Page
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item (4) Low-\/\+Pass Filter
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This Processing Method Does Not Work Properly
\item Avoid Using This Processing Method
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item (5) Compression
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This Processing Method Will Scale the Volume of Your .wav File by a Ratio Based on a Maximum Threshold
\item This Processing Method Will Ask You to Enter a Ratio that Will Scale Aspects of Your File that Exceed the Maximum Threshold, then it Will Ask You to Set a Maximum Threshold
